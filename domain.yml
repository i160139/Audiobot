      caused tens of thousands of deaths around the world in recent years.

      and greenhouse gases collect in the atmosphere and absorb sunlight and solar
      radiation that have bounced off the earthâ€™s surface.
  - text: The greenhouse effect is the process by which radiation from a planet's
      atmosphere warms the planet's surface to a temperature above what it would be
      without this atmosphere.
  - text: Global warming is the temperature of Earth's surface, oceans and atmospheregoing
      up over tens of years. ... The most noticeable changes because of thisincrease
      in temperature is the melting of ice caps all around the world. Sealevel is
      rising steadily because of continental ice melting into the sea.

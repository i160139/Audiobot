  - text: Global warming is the temperature of Earth's surface, oceans and atmosphere
      going up over tens of years. ... The most noticeable changes because of this
      increase in temperature is the melting of ice caps all around the world. Sea
      level is rising steadily because of continental ice melting into the sea.

      atmosphere warms the planet's surface to a temperature above what it would be
      without this atmosphere.

      and greenhouse gases collect in the atmosphere and absorb sunlight and solar
